&sEditorText42=MAP EDITOR HELP&


&sEditorText43=Welcome to the Stick Arena Map Editor!


New Map -- Allows you to create a new map which you can play with anyone.  You will need to purchase at least one map slot from the shop area in order to save your map.

Load Map -- Allows you to load a previously saved custom map.

&sEditorText44=Map Name -- Your map name must be at least 3 characters long and must not be offensive or inappropriate.

Map Size -- Stick Arena Maps are made up of small squares called “Tiles”. The more tiles there are, the larger the map will be (Default size is 12×9 tiles).

Map Theme -- The theme will affect the default ground tiles automatically placed on your map. It will also determine which background will be displayed during the round summary screen, after your map is played.&

&sEditorText45=Select a map from the list below to continue.  Note that you cannot load an empty map slot - return to the Map Editor Menu and select 'New Map' to use an empty map slot.&



&sEditorText46=Toggle Tiles/Spawns Button (Hotkey: M/W) -- This gold button switches your toolbar between the tile editing and weapons/spawns placement mode.

Tile Editing Hotkeys
----

Scroll Map (Arrow Keys) -- Allows you to scroll around your map.

Drag Map (Hotkey: Space Bar) -- An alternative to scrolling, this tool will allow you to move around your map. Click on the “Drag Map” button, then click and drag your left mouse button on a tile to move around the map.

View Tiles (Hotkey: T) -- This button will allow you to view all of the tiles available, one page at a time. Click the arrows at the top to view the other pages of tiles. Clicking on a tile will automatically put you back to your map with the paintbrush tool selected. You can then place the tile where you want it by left clicking on the map.

Paintbrush (Hotkey: P) -- The Paintbrush tool will apply your selected tile wherever you left click on your map. Select a tile through the “View Tiles” button or using the eyedropper tool.

Eye Dropper (Hotkey: E) -- This tool will allow you to easily copy a tile. Click on the “Eye Dropper” tool then click on the tile you would like to copy. Once you have clicked on a tile, you will be automatically switched to the paintbrush tool to then place the duplicated tile on you map.

Rotate Tile (Hotkey: R) -- This tool allows you to turn a tile 90 degrees. Click the “Rotate Tile” button then click on the tile you would like to rotate. To rotate a tile 180 degrees simply click on the tile twice.

Flip Horizontal (Hotkey: H) -- This tool allows you to flip or “mirror” a tile horizontally. Click the “Flip Horizontal” button then click on the tile you would like to flip.

Flip Vertical (Hotkey: V) -- This tool allows you to flip or “mirror” a tile vertically. Click the “Flip Vertical” button then click on the tile you would like to flip.

Save Map (Hotkey: S) -- Allows you to save your map in either an empty map slot, or overtop of an existing map.


Weapons/Spawns Placement Hotkeys
----

Delete Weapon or Player Spawn (Hotkey: X) -- This tool allows you to remove any weapons or player spawns that have been placed on your map by left clicking them.

Place Player Spawn -- This tool assigns a tile on your map to be a location where players will spawn. You are limited to placing 8 player spawns per map and they must occur on a walk-able tile.

Place (Weapon) Spawn -- This tool allows you to place weapons on your map. You are limited to placing 8 weapon spawns per map and they must occur on a walk-able tile.&

Players with a Lab Pass, and those that have been VIP'd by the game creator, can join games with 4 or 5 players already in them (up to the new maximum of 6 players per game).
